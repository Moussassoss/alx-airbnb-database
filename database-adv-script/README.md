ðŸ“˜ Task 0: Joins â€“ Airbnb Database Module

This task demonstrates how to use SQL JOINs to query data across multiple tables in the Airbnb database schema.

ðŸ”‘ Covered JOIN Types
1. INNER JOIN

Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

Example: Fetch all bookings with user and property details.

` SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.username,
    p.title AS property_title,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM Bookings b
INNER JOIN Users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id;
`
2. LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from the left table (Users) and matched rows from the right table (Bookings).

If no booking exists for a user, NULL values are returned for booking fields.

` SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.username,
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
`
3. FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from both tables, whether or not there is a match.

Useful for spotting unbooked properties or bookings with missing property links.
`
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.title AS property_title,
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM Properties p
FULL OUTER JOIN Bookings b ON p.property_id = b.property_id;
